# Pokédex
A Pokédex created using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework along with Dart. [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) is the main source of data.

## Progress
There is still a lot to be done, but the main structure and Pokémon pages already work, feel free to take the source code and finish it your own way.

## Design
Based on Daniel Motta's Pokédex iOS app, which can be found [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/69337385/Pokedex-App) and [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/4862612-Pokedex-iOS-app?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=DanielMots&utm_content=Pokedex%20iOS%20app&utm_medium=Social_Share).
